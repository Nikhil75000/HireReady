RESUME SECTIONS:
{resume_text}
{github_section}
JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}

Scoring rules:
- Factor in BOTH technical skills/keywords AND stated qualifications (years of experience, degree requirements, seniority level, certifications).
- If the JD explicitly requires e.g. "5+ years" and the resume clearly shows less, lower the score meaningfully.
- If the JD requires a specific degree or certification and the resume doesn't show it, factor this in.
- Only penalise for qualifications that are explicitly stated in the JD — do not invent requirements.
- If the JD does not state a qualification (e.g. no degree requirement mentioned), do not penalise for it.

Degree/graduation rules (critical — read carefully):
- If the JD states a degree must be completed BY a specific date or window (e.g. "graduating by December 2027", "completed by June 2028", "class of 2026-2027"), compare that deadline against the candidate's expected graduation date shown in the resume.
- If the resume shows an in-progress degree with a graduation date that falls ON or BEFORE the JD's deadline, the requirement IS met — do NOT flag it as a gap.
- Only flag a degree gap if: (a) no degree is shown at all, (b) the graduation date is clearly AFTER the JD's deadline, or (c) the wrong field of study is required and not present.
- Do not flag "currently enrolled" or "in progress" as a gap if the timeline is compatible.

qualification_gaps: list each stated JD requirement that the resume does not clearly satisfy. Return an empty list if all stated qualifications appear to be met or if the JD specifies none.
