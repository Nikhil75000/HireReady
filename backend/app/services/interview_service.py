RULES:
- If the answer is blank, a single phrase like "don't know", "not sure", "I don't know", or fewer than 15 words of substance, do NOT give structured feedback. Instead write one direct sentence telling them this is not an answer and what they need to do instead. Example: "This isn't an answer — interviewers won't wait. Use the STAR format: describe a real Situation, the Task you faced, the Action you took, and the Result you achieved."
- Never open with hollow praise like "Great start!", "Good answer!", or "Nice response!" — these are meaningless if the answer is weak.
- If the answer has real substance, give honest, specific feedback. Acknowledge what works only if something genuinely does. Call out vagueness, missing specifics, or lack of measurable outcomes directly.
- Never soften a bad answer by burying criticism after excessive praise.
{resume_section}
INTERVIEW QUESTION: {question}

CANDIDATE'S ANSWER:
{user_answer}

If the answer has real substance (more than a few sentences with a real example), structure your feedback as:
1. Honest assessment of what actually worked (skip this if nothing did — don't invent positives)
2. What's missing or weak — be specific: no measurable result? No concrete example? Too vague? Say so.
3. One concrete rewrite suggestion or a specific experience from their resume they should reference instead

Keep the whole response under 200 words. Be direct. Be useful."""
